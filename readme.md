## About The Repository

This is a readme file regarding the relevant details about the repository and its dependencies. The repository is partially made in Romanian Language.

The purpose of this repository is to implement the final project from the _Web Development(Javacript) Program_ from  **The Informal School of IT** in Bucharest, that I started attending since December 5th, 2018.

The project contains 4 HTML pages that include JavaScript and CSS (separate files) implementing the functionalities needed for an e-commerce application (using the AJAX technique and mapping the server response to the JavaScript classes).
